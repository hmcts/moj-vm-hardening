# jenkins-packer

## Description

This repo contains the scripts and config files to create Jenkins agent images.

## Requirements

* Packer

## Renovate config

Renovate has been configured to use the RegexManager with GitHub Tags and endoflife.date.

This will update the versions of tools and utilities in the provisioning script to the latest versions via pull request.

## Adding new packages to be updated by renovate

If you add a new package to the [provisioning script](./provision-jenkins-ubuntu-agent.sh) that can't be installed via package manager and should be updated regularly, add it to the block in the [provisioning script](https://github.com/hmcts/jenkins-packer/blob/master/provision-jenkins-ubuntu-agent.sh#L6-L25).

You will need to add a comment to inform renovate where to search for available versions e.g. on github with `#renovate: datasource=github-tags depName=fluxcd/flux2`

See [renovate datasources](https://docs.renovatebot.com/modules/datasource/) for a list of available sources.

By default, renovate will search for versions using `semver` but if your package uses another format, you will have to indicate what versioning to use e.g. `versioning=regex`

See [renovate versioning](https://docs.renovatebot.com/modules/versioning/) for a list of available versioning schemes.

Because a lot of github releases use `v` prefixes, we have an `echo` statement paired with the `tr` command to remove these in our script when setting the version to be used e.g. `export FLUX_VERSION=$(echo v0.41.2 | tr -d 'v')`.
